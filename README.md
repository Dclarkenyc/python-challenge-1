### Description:
The assignment was to use python to design an interactive menu ordering system for a food truck.
The system will allow customers to place an order using submenusand to store and print the order on a receipt with a total price.

### Usage:
Run the file menu.py and follow the prompts.  The menu order number must be input, not name or other number or string, etc.  To continue with ordering enter lower case y if n is entered, the system will print thank you and then print out a receipt with the order and total price.

### Resources:
The completed assignment is in menu_py.  There were no outside resources, we created the data with information provided in the assignment.  

### Known Issues:
I had trouble with the last couple of questions.  I also think I missed one of 
the responses for incorrect entries.  I did this assignment late and it was 
difficult to try to relearn pandas.
